good example use-case for \`vuex\` \`getters\` : returning only “done” to-dos from a state array (i.e. some kind of filtering has to take place between the state data and the returned data)

don't put state directly in data
 right: onSubmit() this.event.organizer = this.$store.state.user (uh... )
  (instead of putting in data() function )
  
  `import {v4 : uuidv4} from 'uuid'`
